# Project1

## Project Description

This project is about creating a game called "Guitar Hero". It is simplified version of the Guitar Hero game. This game was chosen for the project as it is a game where most people will know how to play and it is simple for children to play as well. The vibrant colors of the game also create a feel good factor for the players.

## Instructions

When the "Start Game" button is pressed, the blocks will start falling.

Users will have to press the associated keys shown on the screen when the keys fall to the bottom of the screen.

When the correct key is pressed as the block is at the bottom, it will register a score.

If the key is not pressed when the block falls beyond the bottom of the screen, it will register a miss.

The game will end if there are more than 10 misses or the game time of 30 seconds are up.

## Known Problems of The Game

The score and the game over are shown in a popup alert function. It can be improved by showing it as a box of text, beautifying the score and the interface of the game. The interface of the game can also be improved by allowing game users to change the game time and the speed of the falling blocks.
