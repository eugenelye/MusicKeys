# Project1

## Project Description
This project is about creating a game called "Guitar Hero". It is simplified version of the Guitar Hero game. 

## Instructions
When the "Start Game" button is pressed, the blocks will start falling. 

Users will have to press the associated keys shown on the screen when the keys fall to the bottom of the screen. 

When the correct key is pressed as the block is at the bottom, it will register a score. 

If the key is not pressed when the block falls beyond the bottom of the screen, it will register a miss. 

The game will end if there are more than 5 misses or the game time of 30 seconds are up. 

## Game Images



## Programming Languages 
HTML CSS and Javascript are the programming langagues used for this project. 

## Known Problems of The Game
The score and the game over are shown in an alert function. It can be improved by showing it as a pop up box of text, beautifying the score and the interface of the game. The interface of the game can also be improved by allowing game users to change the game time and the speed of the falling blocks.
